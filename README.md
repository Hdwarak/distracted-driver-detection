# Distracted Driver Detection

This project aims to detect distracted driving behaviors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on a dataset of images categorized into ten classes representing different types of driver distractions.

## Project Overview

Distracted driving is a significant cause of road accidents. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to identify various forms of driver distractions, helping to improve road safety. The model classifies images into the following categories:

- Safe driving (c0)
- Texting - right (c1)
- Talking on the phone - right (c2)
- Texting - left (c3)
- Talking on the phone - left (c4)
- Operating the radio (c5)
- Drinking (c6)
- Reaching behind (c7)
- Hair and makeup (c8)
- Talking to passenger (c9)
  

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model training and evaluation
- Random image selection and prediction
- Model deployment for real-time predictions
